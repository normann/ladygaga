This is my first git repository way back to Feb 15, 2011. In the first place, I created this repo just for testing what a GIT versioning
mechanism can offer. I was falling love with it right after playing with GIT a bit.

Since then, my company (SilverStripe at the time) switch the source version control to GIT, and this repository became a inactive one for a while till
years ago when I was asked to help a kid in middle school to finish his web project as request by one of his course/paper, I relized that this repository
could be reused to hold up any random projects or even some documents that need to keep a version snapshot along to the document lifetime.

That is why this repo is filled with lots of unrelated stuff. :)
