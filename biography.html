						I was first born China and lived in my mothers hometown of Beijing for 3 years. As I migrated to New Zealand at a young age with my mother and father, my knowledge of the Chinese vocabulary slowly faded, and as of now, I am not fluent in the language, but can still understand what others are saying. My first home, we were very poor and were struggling, and along with my grandparents in China who had worser living conditions than us. As we moved from house to house, we began to stabalize with better jobs. After many years of saving for money, and from the help of relatives and friends, we eventually turned out to have decent living styles. After repeating similar steps, and my father graduating in Victoria University and my mother moving from job to job with better pay rise, things start to go up hill from there. We would sometimes, though not often go to China to revisit my relatives there and go see the great wall and other tourists attractions, and would return the favor someday to show them Wellington, when they gather enough money, to inadvance, come visit us.
